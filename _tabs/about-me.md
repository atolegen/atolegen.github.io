I am a visiting scholar at  Design and Augmented Intelligence Lab ([DAIL](https://dail.human.cornell.edu/)), Cornell University, hosted by Saleh Kalantari.

I defended my Phd degree in Robotics Engineering at [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz/) on November 10, 2023. The title of my Phd dissertation was ["Industrial safety using Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence"](https://www.youtubeeducation.com/watch?v=qAMpkp8Uwjs).

 My research interests encompass wayfinding, industrial safety, augmented reality, and computer vision. During my doctoral research, I created the first examples of AI-integrated augmented reality systems for improving industrial safety. My works appeared in top journals such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics and IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems and also as a chapter in the prestigious Handbook of Augmented Reality. 
 
 I presented my studies at the [RAAI 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10601208) and [ICCAR 2025](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=OTAyct0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=OTAyct0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC) conferences.

I have actively contributed to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for reputable journals (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics) and conferences (e.g., IEEE EDUCON, ICECCO). I am a member of IEEE. During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting student at Tokai University. 

Presently, I am based in Ithaca, NY. I love playing soccer, table tennis, and ice skating in my free time. My name means "paid", and is pronounced "tuolegen". I am open to any discussions or collaboration opportunities.
